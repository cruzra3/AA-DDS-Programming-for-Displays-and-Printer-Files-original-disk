	DDS Programming for Display & Printer Files

You have successfully loaded the example programs onto the hard
drive on your PC. The files have been loaded into directory PRGDDS.

To load the programs onto your AS/400, you will use the 
NEWS 3X/400 Code Upload Facility, which has been loaded onto your
PC. The text file READ.UPL explains how to use this facility.

The NEWS 3X/400 Code Upload Facility will copy the source code onto your AS/400 and optionally create it. There are two versions of the facility: one for DOS and one for Windows. If you are running PC Support with Windows, we recommend using the Windows version of the facility, because it provides on-line help. We also recommend that you use the Upload & Compile option to avoid any problems.
